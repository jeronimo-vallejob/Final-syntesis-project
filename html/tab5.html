<h3>The expansion of the universe</h3>
<p>
  The expansion of the universe is a phenomenon that refers to the fact that the
  space-time in which we live is constantly growing, which means that galaxies
  and other astronomical objects are moving away from each other as time
  progresses. The theory of the expansion of the universe was first proposed by
  the Belgian physicist Georges Lemaitre in the 1920s and was confirmed by the
  American astronomer Edwin Hubble in the 1930s.
  <br />
  <br />
  The most direct evidence of the expansion of the universe comes from
  observations of light emitted by distant galaxies. If the universe were not
  expanding, then the light from distant galaxies should reach us at the same
  wavelength that it was originally emitted. However, due to the expansion of
  the universe, the wavelength of the light is stretched as it travels through
  space, which means that the light shifts towards the red end of the
  electromagnetic spectrum.
  <br />
  <br />
  The relationship between the expansion of the universe and the Big Bang is
  because the most accepted cosmological model is the Big Bang, which describes
  the origin of the universe as a big explosion that occurred about 13.8 billion
  years ago. According to this theory, the universe began as an extremely dense
  and hot region that then rapidly and continuously expanded since then. The
  evidence for the expansion of the universe is considered one of the strongest
  pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory.
  <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, the expansion of the universe also has important implications
  for the evolution of the universe in the future. According to current
  observations, the rate of expansion of the universe appears to be
  accelerating, which is believed to be due to dark energy, a form of energy
  that is found throughout the universe and has a repulsive gravitational
  effect. If this acceleration continues, it is possible that galaxies will
  eventually move too far apart from each other and the universe will become
  increasingly cold and dark, a scenario known as the heat death of the
  universe.
