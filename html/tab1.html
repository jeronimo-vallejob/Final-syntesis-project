<h3>Redshift</h3>
<p>
  Redshift is related to the Doppler effect, which is the change in the
  frequency of light or sound due to the relative motion between the wave source
  and the observer. In the case of redshift, it occurs when the light source
  (such as a galaxy) is moving away from us at a considerable velocity. As a
  result, the wavelength of light is stretched, which decreases its frequency
  and makes the light appear more red. This Doppler effect can be observed in
  many sources of light, including stars and distant galaxies. By measuring the
  redshift of light emitted by these sources, astronomers can determine the
  speed at which they are moving away from us. In summary, redshift is related
  to the Doppler effect and occurs when the light source is moving away from us
  at a considerable velocity, which causes the wavelength of light to stretch
  and decrease its frequency.
