<h3>Redshift</h3>
<p>
  Redshift is a phenomenon in which the wavelength of light is stretched and
  shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the relative motion between
  the light source and the observer. This phenomenon occurs when a light source,
  such as a galaxy, is moving away from us at a considerable velocity.
  <br />
  The amount of redshift can be measured by comparing the wavelength of light
  emitted by a light source in the visible spectrum with the wavelength of the
  same light observed on Earth. The relationship between the observed wavelength
  and the emitted wavelength is known as the redshift factor (z). This factor
  can be calculated using the following formula:
  <br />
  <br />
</p>

<p id="for">z = (λ<sub>obs</sub> - λ<sub>emit</sub>) / λ<sub>emit</sub></p>

<p>
  Where λ_obs is the observed wavelength of the light and λ_emit is the
  wavelength emitted by the light source.
  <br />
  Redshift is related to the Doppler effect, which is the change in the
  frequency of light or sound due to the relative motion between the wave source
  and the observer. In the case of redshift, it occurs when the light source
  (such as a galaxy) is moving away from us at a considerable velocity. As a
  result, the wavelength of light is stretched, which decreases its frequency
  and makes the light appear more red. This Doppler effect can be observed in
  many sources of light, including stars and distant galaxies.
  <br />
  Measuring the redshift of light emitted by distant sources is a crucial tool
  for astronomers to determine the velocity and direction of movement of these
  sources, which in turn provides information about the structure and evolution
  of the universe.

<h3>The Hubble's law</h3>

<p>
  The Hubble's law, also known as the law of the expansion of the universe,
  states that the velocity at which a galaxy is moving away from us is directly
  related to its distance from us. This law was proposed by the astronomer Edwin
  Hubble in 1929 and was based on his observations of nearby galaxies. The
  Hubble's law is important because it suggests that the universe is expanding
  uniformly in all directions. This means that if we were to go back in time,
  all galaxies would have been closer together in the past and ultimately
  originated from a single point, known as the Big Bang.
  <br />
  <br />
  The "z" parameter of the Hubble's law refers to the redshift observed in the
  light emitted by distant galaxies. This redshift is due to the Doppler effect
  produced by the expansion of the universe and is related to the velocity at
  which the galaxy is moving away from us.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Hubble constant, denoted by "H0", is a cosmological parameter that
  represents the rate of expansion of the universe at present time. The value of
  the Hubble constant is estimated by measuring the recession velocities of
  distant galaxies and comparing them with their distances. The currently
  accepted value of the Hubble constant is approximately 73.3 km/s/Mpc.
