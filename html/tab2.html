<h3>Blueshift</h3>
<p>
  Blue shift is the phenomenon where the spectral lines of a light source are
  shifted towards shorter wavelengths. This effect occurs when the source is
  approaching an observer and is due to the Doppler effect. In an astronomical
  context, blue shift indicates that the light source is moving towards us,
  which can occur when a star or galaxy is approaching us.
  <br />
  Quasars are extremely luminous astronomical objects located at the center of
  some galaxies. Because they are very far away from us, quasars exhibit a very
  high red shift in their spectrum. However, some quasars exhibit blue shifts,
  suggesting that they are closer to us than originally thought.
  <br />
  Blue shift is less common than red shift, as most astronomical objects are
  moving away from us. However, there are some cases where the light source is
  approaching, such as in the example of quasars mentioned earlier.
