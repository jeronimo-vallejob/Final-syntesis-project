<h3>Blueshift</h3>
<p>
  Blue shift is the displacement towards shorter wavelengths of the spectral
  lines of a light source. This effect occurs when the source is approaching an
  observer and is due to the Doppler effect. In the astronomical context, blue
  shift indicates that the light source is moving towards us, which can occur
  when a star or a galaxy is moving towards us. An example is:
  <br />
  Quasars: Quasars are extremely luminous astronomical objects located at the
  center of some galaxies. Because they are very far away from us, quasars
  exhibit a very high red shift in their spectrum. However, some quasars exhibit
  blue shifts, suggesting that they are closer to us than originally thought.
