<h3>Big Bang Evidence</h3>
<p>
  The Hubble's law, also known as the law of the expansion of the universe,
  states that the velocity at which a galaxy is moving away from us is directly
  related to its distance from us. This law was proposed by the astronomer Edwin
  Hubble in 1929 and was based on his observations of nearby galaxies. The
  Hubble's law is important because it suggests that the universe is expanding
  uniformly in all directions. This means that if we were to go back in time,
  all galaxies would have been closer together in the past and ultimately
  originated from a single point, known as the Big Bang.

  The "z" parameter of the Hubble's law refers to the redshift observed in the
  light emitted by distant galaxies. This redshift is due to the Doppler effect
  produced by the expansion of the universe and is related to the velocity at
  which the galaxy is moving away from us.

  The Hubble constant, denoted by "H0", is a cosmological parameter that
  represents the rate of expansion of the universe at present time. The value of
  the Hubble constant is estimated by measuring the recession velocities of
  distant galaxies and comparing them with their distances. The currently
  accepted value of the Hubble constant is approximately 73.3 km/s/Mpc.
