<h3>The nucleosynthesis of the Big Bang</h3>
<p>
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis is the process by which the nuclei of the
  lightest chemical elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium, were formed
  during the first few minutes after the Big Bang.
  <br />
  <br />
  In the early moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and
  dense. In this environment, the nuclei of hydrogen and helium were formed
  through the fusion of protons and neutrons. The nuclei of lithium were also
  formed, although in much smaller quantities.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis was a crucial process in the formation of the
  universe as we know it today, as it was the first time that elements heavier
  than hydrogen and helium were formed. These light elements are the building
  blocks of stars and galaxies.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred during a short period of time,
  approximately between one second and a few minutes after the Big Bang. After
  this period, the temperature and density of the universe decreased enough for
  nuclear fusion processes to stop and existing nuclei began to combine to form
  atoms.
