<h3>The nucleosynthesis of the Big Bang</h3>
<p>
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis is the process by which the nuclei of the
  lightest chemical elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium, were formed
  during the first few minutes after the Big Bang.
  <br />
  <br />
  In the early moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and
  dense. In this environment, the nuclei of hydrogen and helium were formed
  through the fusion of protons and neutrons. The nuclei of lithium were also
  formed, although in much smaller quantities.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis was a crucial process in the formation of the
  universe as we know it today, as it was the first time that elements heavier
  than hydrogen and helium were formed. These light elements are the building
  blocks of stars and galaxies.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred during a short period of time,
  approximately between one second and a few minutes after the Big Bang. After
  this period, the temperature and density of the universe decreased enough for
  nuclear fusion processes to stop and existing nuclei began to combine to form
  atoms.

<h3>Abundance of light elements</h3>
<p>
  The abundance of chemical elements refers to the frequency at which certain
  elements are found in the universe. These elements are mainly produced in
  stars through nuclear fusion and then distributed throughout the universe
  through processes such as supernova explosions.
  <br />
  Most of the universe is made up of hydrogen and helium, as these elements were
  produced during the Big Bang. However, there are small amounts of other
  elements that have been formed through fusion processes inside stars, such as
  carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron.
