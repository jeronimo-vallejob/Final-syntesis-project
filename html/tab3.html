<h3>Cosmic Microwave Background</h3>
<p>
  The cosmic microwave background radiation is a radiation that fills the entire
  universe and originated approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This
  radiation has a very precise spectral distribution, known as the blackbody
  spectrum, which corresponds to the current temperature of the universe (2.725
  K). The existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation is one of the
  most solid pieces of evidence that the universe underwent a large initial
  explosion (the Big Bang) and has been expanding since then. The cosmic
  microwave background is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big
  Bang because its existence and properties match exactly what is expected if
  the universe began with a big explosion approximately 13.8 billion years ago.
  Moreover, the small fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave
  background provide information about the distribution of matter in the early
  universe, which is also consistent with the Big Bang model.
